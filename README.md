# Getting started

## Prerequisites
1. You must install the Power BI desktop application either from [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/), or directly from the [Microsoft store](https://www.microsoft.com/nb-no/store/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t).
2. You must have a valid [Printix](https://www.printix.net) Subscription.

## Step 1 - Deploy the Power BI report and configure a scheduled update 

To ensure everyone in your organization, or even guests, can view the report, you have to publish it to Power BI online.

### Step 1.4 Set up a schedule

To refresh the data daily, you need to configure a scheduled refresh. Click on **Scheduled refresh** under the datasets settings. The refresh should run 15-30 minutes after the data export from Printix is finished.

Example of a scheduled refresh;

 Now do a [manual refresh]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/refresh-data) of your dataset, and youâ€™re ready!

# Editing the Power BI template
You can freely alter the Power BI templates as needed for your organization. If you create something awesome, we hope you will share it back with the community!

## Changing the Power BI design
The Power BI design is created in PowerPoint and can easily be edited. You can find the design under the "PowerPoint" folder. The design is mostly built using Storyboards.

When you have altered the design in PowerPoint, and exported the slides as "PNGs", you can set them as background images in Power BI. This is done from the "Visualizations" view. Remember to set the "image fit" selector to "fit". 
The Images from PowerPoint is saved under the 'Images\PowerPoint' directory.
