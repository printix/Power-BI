# Editing the Power BI template
You can freely alter the Power BI templates as needed for your organization. If you create something awesome, we hope you will share it back with the community!

## Changing the Power BI design
The Power BI design is created in PowerPoint and can easily be edited. You can find the design under the "PowerPoint" folder. The design is mostly built using Storyboards.

When you have altered the design in PowerPoint, and exported the slides as "PNGs", you can set them as background images in Power BI. This is done from the "Visualizations" view. Remember to set the "image fit" selector to "fit". 
The Images from PowerPoint is saved under the 'Images\PowerPoint' directory.
